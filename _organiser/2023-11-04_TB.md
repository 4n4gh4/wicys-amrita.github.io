## Report
The Tech Probe Quiz was active from 6<sup>th</sup> October 2023 to 4<sup>th</sup> November 2023, on the Instagram handle of Cyber Awareness Month <a href="https://www.instagram.com/avvcyber_cam/">(@avvcyber_cam)</a>. The primary
objective of the Tech Probe quiz was to educate and engage participants in a meaningful exploration of cybersecurity topics by assessing their existing
knowledge and introducing them to various new concepts related to cyber security, emerging threats, and preventive measures. We aimed to equip our participants
with the skills and information necessary to safeguard their digital presence.

The quiz was designed with a diverse range of questions that started from fundamentals of Cyber Security. The questions for each day were based on the theme 
of that day. Participants were encouraged to test their understanding of digital safety and, in the process, uncover areas where they could bolster their defences.
The quiz was organized by a dedicated team of second and third year B.Tech Cyber Security Students. The team comprised of Ms. Amita Narayanan Kutty,
Ms. Adithya N S, Mr. Kolluru Sai Supraj, Mr. Tangella Sree Chandan, Mr. Harshith Gangisetty, Mr. Mittul R, Mr. Venkata Revan Nagireddy, Mr. Dharmik S, 
Mr. Achyuth Anand, and Ms. Aishwarya GS played a pivotal role in fabricating the questions and promoting the quiz.

To ensure a fair and informative experience for all participants, a set of rules and regulations on formulating the questions and choosing winners were established:
<ul>
<li>The questions would be posted every day at 7 PM in the interval of 5 minutes on every alternate day. 
</li>
<li>The theme for the questions was based on the speciality of each day.
</li>
<li>Answers and winners would be announced at 7 PM on the succeeding day of posting the questions.
</li>	
<li>The winning criteria considered the time taken to attempt the question combined with providing the right answer. 
</li>
<li>The first person to respond with the correct answer for each question earned 5 points and the succeeding person to correctly answer gained 4 points and point distribution went on for the succeeding three people. 
</li>
<li>Each day, the winners of the three questions were calculated using the criteria mentioned above and the 5 winners for the day were decided based on number of points acquired by each participant. 
</li>
<li>The five winners hence chosen were sent an appreciation message recognising their achievement. In addition to this the details of their college and branch were asked for recording purpose. 
</li>
<li>Posting of winners were done in such a way that they were tagged, and their year, branch and college details were specified.
</li>
</ul>

An Excel spreadsheet was maintained to record the participants and winners. The document also included details such as their Instagram usernames, 
whether they attempted the questions, and if attempted, whether the answers were correct. For every question they attempted, two points were awarded, 
and their overall points were calculated.
